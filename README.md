This a django project i built for my final year Unviersity course.
     - it enable schools or departments to:
              -> manage exams: i.e create exams for a specific section and give results automatically
              -> manage attendances: i.e using face recognition it enable schools to take attendance of  both teacher and student.
This project is useful for creating a safe examination and attendance tracking system.
